📦 std::vector
✅ Definition

A dynamic array that stores elements in contiguous memory and allows fast access by index.

🧠 Memory Structure
[ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 ]

Single continuous block.
When full → new larger block → copy/move elements.

➕ Positive Points

✔ Fastest iteration (cache-friendly)
✔ Random access O(1)
✔ Low memory overhead
✔ Fast push_back()
✔ Best general-purpose container

📦 std::deque
✅ Definition

A sequence container allowing fast insertion/removal at both front and back.

🧠 Memory Structure
block + block + block + block

Multiple fixed-size blocks, not contiguous.

➕ Positive Points

✔ Fast push_front() and push_back()
✔ No big reallocation
✔ Random access O(1)
✔ References more stable than vector

📦 std::list (Doubly Linked List)
✅ Definition

A container where each element is stored in a node connected with pointers.

🧠 Memory Structure
[prev|data|next] <-> [prev|data|next] <-> [prev|data|next]

Each element is separate in memory.

➕ Positive Points

✔ Fast insertion anywhere (if iterator known)
✔ Fast deletion anywhere
✔ No reallocation ever
✔ Iterators remain valid after insertions

📦 std::set
✅ Definition

An ordered associative container that stores unique elements in sorted order.

🧠 Memory Structure

Balanced binary tree (usually Red-Black Tree):

        8
      /   \
     3     12
    / \      \
   1   6      15
➕ Positive Points

✔ Elements always sorted
✔ No duplicates
✔ Fast search O(log n)
✔ Fast insert/delete O(log n)
✔ Useful for membership tests
